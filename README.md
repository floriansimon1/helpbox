*Yet another collection of utility functions*

_CAUTION: THIS IS NOT STABLE SOFTWARE. THE API COULD CHANGE ANY MINUTE_

## Introduction
This a collection utility functions that we at TenTwentyFour got tired of rewriting for every single JS project. Even though the API is unstable, you can expect any installed version to keep working if you update as this package follows semver.

### Running tests
`$ npm test`
### Documentation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:tentwentyfour/helpbox.git

```
